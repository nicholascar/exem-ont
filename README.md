# Exemplification Ontology

An ontology for the description of examples.

This ontology mostly reuses existing ontologies' classes and properties for the description of examples. The examples are typically of OWL classes and properties themselves and their use, but they could be of anything.

This ontology will soon be a public product, published by [SURROUND Australia Pty ltd.](https://surroundaustralia.com).
